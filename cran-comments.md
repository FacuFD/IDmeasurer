## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Started the Description with: "Provides...".
* Used double quotes instead of single quotes for a paper name in Description.
* In Description, added a link for a paper in form: authors (year) <doi:...>

## Test environments
* local Windows 10 install, R 3.5.3
* ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.5.3

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 notes

* This is a new release.
